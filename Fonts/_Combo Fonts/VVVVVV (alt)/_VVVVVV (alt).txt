Font yoinked from the graphics of Terry Cavanagh's game VVVVVV.

play VVVVVV!!!!!!!!!!! -TetraTonics

P.S. I sliiiiiiightly altered the "4" in the font
to make it look more aligned with the other numbers. :P

P.S.S. For the ()/.-% chars in the second line of the font,
I extended the typography with some extrapolation based on the
design elements present in the original typography.
These character did not exist in the original typography,
only the numbers did.
This update was made to make sure that the subtractive scoring text
displays properly.
